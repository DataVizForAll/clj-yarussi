          <h2>Where do the Highest Amounts of Recyclable Material Come From in Our Hartford Area?</h2>
          <p>Hartford and its surrounding areas are home to nearly 900,000 people. This includes people from all demographics and races, and within a world that is constantly inventing and evolving there is only one thing that is moving at the same rate as our humanity. The answer is our waste and recycling products. It is known that all around the world, the amount of recycling being produced has only increased as time goes on. We are currently living in a plastic-age of life. Let it be known that nearly half of the plastic ever made in the world has only been made in the past 13 years. But how does this affect us? How does this affect the town that I am living in? How much am I contributing to this issue? Well let's take a look within our own backyard and see how responsible we, the people in the surrounding Hartford area, are for this. 
     </p> To do this I found data from CT Deep that gives us the total tons of recyclables from varying collection sites within Connecticut, more specifically near Hartford, and in order to answer our question I compiled the total recyclables values for each town as a whole. Then I needed to separate them by municipal and residential tons, and the just residential tons alone.

          <h2>Compiling Data and Expressing Clarity Between Municipalities and Residents Alone</h2>
          <p>  I created a Spreadsheet (linked in work cited) that expresses the required data that will be utilized to show the discrepancy, in pounds, between residential recyclables total and nonresidential totals by day. This data will be shown as Chart 1 and will go hand-in-hand with the data in a map known as Map 1.</p>
          
          <iframe title="Pounds of Recyclables Produced Per Day by Towns " aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-7Bgh6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7Bgh6/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="640" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
          </p>Chart 1- Data Overview of the Total Recyclables Produced Each Day by Pound in Hartford Area </p>
        </p>  
    </p>  This data may seem overwhelming but will be easier seen in visualizations as a chart and as Map 1 to help illustrate the discrepancies and the data expressed in the spreadsheet . The first stage of this design is to find out how much municipalities affected the number of recyclables near Hartford. This allows us to separate the commercial numbers from the residential, allowing for more accurate data per person without inflated rates and biases for each. To do this we created maps based off of the non-residential and residential pounds per day and then a map of the combined weights to see how they compared to other town totals. The data used for this will be illustrated in this map and, for reference, it is using the first 5 columns on the Google Sheet screenshot. </p>
      
    <iframe title="Vernon and Farmington are Leading in Total Pounds of Municipal and Residential Recyclables" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-7monD" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7monD/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="662" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
</p> Map 1- Recyclables demographic of Both Residential and Municipal </p>
</p> This data represents the pounds of recyclables in the towns near Hartford by day with both residential and non-residential included. 
     The map below represents the same data but with Non-Resident amounts taken out. So, quite simply, it just represents the Residential totals by day. Let it be known that ALL maps will be using the same legend values in order to help demonstrate the most accurate comparison of the main sources of our recycling. </p>

          <p>Map 2- Recyclable Demographic for Residents Alone </p>
          </p></p>
          </p>This data represents the pounds of recyclables in the towns near Hartford by day with both residential and non-residential included. The map below represents the same data but with Non-Resident amounts taken out. So, quite simply, it just represents the Residential totals by day. Let it be known that ALL maps will be using the same legend values in order to help demonstrate the most accurate comparison of the main sources of our recycling.</p>
          <p> To get the more advanced calculation results, like the pounds per day and per year. I took the averages from all the towns recyclables near Hartford for both non-residential and residential, then just residents alone, and then the non-residentials alone. Then I found the number of tons that would be used per year by an “individual”. From there I converted it to a more understandable unit, pounds, to make it easier to visualize as the reader, as well as allowing for the legend to make more sense. After this, I divided it by 365 to get the pounds of recyclables per day. I did this for both maps and used the same legend to express the discrepancy between only resident values and with both residents and larger municipalities included. These calculated values can be found in the google sheet, which is pasted under sources.</p>

</script>
      </p>This map expresses the data similar to the style of that of Map 2, however it expresses the recyclables for Non Residents. This includes: Businesses, Municipalities…etc, quite simply everything that isn’t produced by residents privately. This graph is useful because you can see how the colors for Map 2 and Map 3 can be combined to form the total recyclable pounds by day for each town, which is shown in Map 1

          <h2>Section 4: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>
